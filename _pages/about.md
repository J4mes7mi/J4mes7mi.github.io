My name is Nanjun Zheng. I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s studies in Business Analytics with a Financial Technology track at Washington University in St. Louis, starting in August 2024. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the AIRS Lab, Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, where I co-authored a paper on optimizing EV charging station upgrades using game theory. I also contributed to 3D scene reconstruction research at the Deep Bit Lab, Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, under the guidance of Professor Zhen Li. Earlier in my career, I interned at JD.com as a business analyst, where I developed strategies that boosted e-commerce traffic and sales. Additionally, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on big data processing and correlation analysis. My current interests include business analytics, financial technology, and leveraging data-driven insights for real-world problem-solving.
